I'm a software engineer currently interested in deepening my understanding of Golang along with its frameworks like Echo. 
Not only that, but I'm also experienced in using other tools and frameworks such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, Hapi, OpenAPI, and React. As a software engineer, I constantly try to prioritize clean code so I always try to implement popular software design principles like Clean Architecture into practice.

Check out my repositories to see what I'm capable of!

Skills: GO / TYPESCRIPT / NODEJS / OPENAPI / REACT
